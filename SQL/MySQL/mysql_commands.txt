Important: Some commands are specific to Fedora Linux, but most should work on other operating systems too.

I. MySQL Terminal Commands:

  1. sudo mysql --> runs MySQL as a root user.

  2. mysql -u user -p --> runs MySQL with a specific user (-u) and password (-p).

  3. CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password'; --> This command creates a new user. 'localhost' is the address of your server — in this case, it refers to your local machine, but it can also be replaced with a remote address.

  4. DROP USER 'username'@'localhost'; --> Delete a MySQL user.

  5. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost'; --> This command grants all privileges on a specific database to a user. You can replace database_name.* with *.* to grant privileges on all databases (global privileges). You can also specify in which table for example: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.table_name TO 'user_name'@'localhost'; (.* means to all tables).

  6. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION; --> The "WITH GRANT OPTION" clause allows that user to grant the same privileges to other users.

  You can also specify which privileges you want to grant. For example: 
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost';

  | Privilege      | Description                                    |
  | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
  |  SELECT        | Read data from tables                          |
  |  INSERT        | Add new rows                                   |
  |  UPDATE        | Modify existing data                           |
  |  DELETE        | Remove rows                                    |
  |  CREATE        | Create new tables or databases                 |
  |  DROP          | Delete tables or databases                     |
  |  ALTER         | Modify table structure                         |
  |  INDEX         | Create or remove indexes                       |
  |  GRANT OPTION  | Allow user to grant their privileges to others |

  7. SHOW DATABASES; --> Show all databases.

  8. CREATE DATABASE database_name; --> This command creates a new database.

  9. USE database_name; --> This command selects a database to use.

  10. DROP DATABASE database_name; --> Delete a database.

  11. SHOW TABLES; --> Shows all tables.

  12. DROP TABLE table_name; --> Delete a table.

  13. DESCRIBE table_name; --> Describe a table (see columns). 

  14. SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user; --> Shows all MySQL users and the host from which each user is allowed to connect.

  15. Exit; --> Exits MySQL and returns to the system terminal.

II. Check MySQL status and more:

  1. sudo systemctl status mysqld --> This checks if MySQl server is running or not.

  2. sudo systemctl start mysqld --> If not running, start it.

  3. sudo systemctl stop mysqld --> Stops MySQL.

  4. sudo systemctl enable mysqld --> Enable MySQL to start at boot.

  5. sudo systemctl disable mysqld --> Disable MySQL from starting at boot.

  6. sudo systemctl restart mysqld --> Restart MySQL.
